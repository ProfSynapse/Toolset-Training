This is a critical financial decision that needs more careful analysis.\n\n**Why max approval ≠ what you can afford:**\n1. **Banks maximize their profit, not your financial health:**\n   - They calculate based on debt-to-income ratios (often up to 43-50%)\n   - Doesn't account for your actual lifestyle and expenses\n   - Doesn't leave room for emergencies or savings\n   - They make more money when you borrow more\n\n2. **The real costs beyond mortgage:**\n   - Property taxes (can be $500-1000+/month)\n   - Homeowners insurance ($100-300+/month)\n   - HOA fees if applicable ($100-500+/month)\n   - Maintenance and repairs (budget 1-3% of home value annually)\n   - Utilities (often higher than renting)\n   - Furniture and improvements\n   - Emergency fund for major repairs (roof, HVAC, etc.)\n\n3. **Financial experts recommend:**\n   - Borrow 2-3x your annual income, not 4-5x\n   - Keep housing costs under 28% of gross income\n   - Have 6 months expenses saved AFTER down payment and closing\n   - Don't max out just because you can\n\n4. **Life changes that could happen:**\n   - Job loss or income reduction\n   - Medical expenses\n   - Car breakdown\n   - Family emergencies\n   - Want to change careers\n   - Having children\n   - Being house-poor means no financial flexibility\n\n**What you should do instead:**\n1. **Calculate actual affordability:**\n   - List ALL monthly expenses (not just mortgage)\n   - Include savings goals\n   - Factor in the additional costs above\n   - Be honest about your lifestyle\n\n2. **Better target:**\n   - Aim for 60-80% of max approval\n   - In your case: $300k-400k range\n   - This leaves breathing room\n   - You can always upgrade later\n\n3. **Run the numbers:**\n   - What's your gross monthly income?\n   - Current monthly expenses?\n   - Emergency fund size?\n   - Other debts?\n   - Retirement savings rate?\n\n**Red flags if you buy at max:**\n- Living paycheck to paycheck in a nice house\n- Can't afford to furnish it\n- Stress about every unexpected expense\n- No vacations or discretionary spending\n- Relationship stress from money issues\n- Can't contribute to retirement\n\n**Questions to answer first:**\n- Why do you want to max out the approval?\n- What's your actual monthly take-home pay?\n- Do you have 3-6 months expenses saved beyond down payment?\n- What would happen if you lost your job?\n\nPlease run a detailed budget before committing to max approval.

What percentage ownership?\n- What's the valuation? Who else is investing?\n\n**If you're still considering it:**\n- Only invest what you can afford to LOSE COMPLETELY\n- Max 5-10% of savings ($2,500-5,000)\n- Get everything in writing with a lawyer\n- Understand it's likely gone forever\n- Treat it as a gift you'll never see again\n\n**What you should say:**\n\"I care about you and I want your business to succeed, but I can't invest my life savings in any single investment, even with my best friend. I need to protect my financial security. If you need investment, professional investors exist for this reason.\"\n\n**Alternative:**\n- Offer to help in non-financial ways\n- Provide feedback on the business plan\n- Make introductions to potential customers\n- Support as a friend, not an investor\n\n**The hard truth:**\n- A true friend wouldn't ask you to risk your entire savings\n- This request shows poor judgment on his part\n- If he's offended by you saying no, that's a red flag about the friendship\n\n**Statistically:**\n- You have ~90% chance of losing everything\n- ~9% chance of modest return\n- ~1% chance of significant return\n\nWould you go to a casino and put $50k on a number with 90% chance of losing?

(They need a large bed)\n   - Food/water bowls take floor space\n   - Dog supplies (toys, crates, etc.) have nowhere to go\n   - Giant breed = giant poops (and no yard to do it in)\n   - Destructive behavior from lack of space/exercise\n   - Barking/noise complaints from neighbors\n   - Your apartment will smell\n\n4. **Financial reality:**\n   - Great Danes are expensive:\n   - Food: $100-150/month (they eat A LOT)\n   - Vet bills: giant breeds have major health issues\n   - Hip dysplasia, bloat, heart problems\n   - Insurance or emergency fund needed\n   - May need dog walker ($15-30/day)\n\n5. **Landlord/lease issues:**\n   - Many landlords prohibit large dogs\n   - Breed restrictions\n   - Pet deposits often higher for large dogs\n   - Potential eviction if unauthorized\n\n6. **Quality of life - for the dog:**\n   - Dogs need stimulation, space, exercise\n   - A Great Dane in 500 sq ft is borderline cruel\n   - Would you want to spend your life in one small room?\n   - This is about the dog's wellbeing, not just your desires\n\n**Better options:**\n1. **Wait until you have appropriate space:**\n   - Larger apartment or house\n   - Access to yard or dog park\n   - When you can truly accommodate a giant breed\n\n2. **Consider apartment-appropriate dogs:**\n   - Smaller breeds (under 30 lbs)\n   - Lower energy breeds\n   - Greyhounds (surprisingly good apartment dogs despite size)\n   - French Bulldogs, Cavaliers, older rescue dogs\n\n3. **Get your dog fix without ownership:**\n   - Foster small dogs\n   - Volunteer at shelter\n   - Dog walking/sitting for income\n   - Visit friends' dogs\n\n**Questions to honestly answer:**\n- Can you walk a dog 1-2 hours daily in rain, snow, heat?\n- Do you have $3,000-5,000 for emergency vet bills?\n- Is your lease allows large dogs?\n- Where will you be in 10 years?
