This can result in inconsistent data and errors. 3) The use of a synchronization process that is not designed to handle conflicts between different versions of the same data. This can lead to an infinite loop where one version of the data overwrites another, which then overwrites the first, and so on. 4) The lack of proper error handling in the synchronization process. If an error occurs during synchronization, it may not be handled properly, leading to a failure that can cause the sync loop to continue indefinitely. 5) The use of a synchronization process that is not designed to handle changes made by other users. This can lead to conflicts where one user's changes overwrite another user's changes, resulting in an infinite loop. 6) The lack of proper logging and monitoring of the synchronization process.
