RESTful Design\\n\\nFollow REST architectural constraints:\\n- **Client-Server**: Clear separation of concerns\\n- **Stateless**: Each request contains all needed information\\n- **Cacheable**: Responses explicitly indicate cacheability\\n- **Layered System**: Client cannot tell if connected directly to server\\n- **Uniform Interface**: Consistent resource identification and manipulation\\n\\n### 2. Resource-Oriented\\n\\nDesign around resources, not actions:\\n\\n```\\nGOOD:\\nGET /api/users/{id}\\nPOST /api/users\\nPUT /api/users/{id}\\nDELETE /api/users/{id}\\n\\nBAD:\\nGET /api/getUser?id=123\\nPOST /api/createUser\\nPOST /api/updateUser\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Consistent Naming\\n\\n- Use plural nouns for collections: `/users`, `/products`\\n- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/user-profiles`\\n- Avoid verbs in URLs (use HTTP methods instead)\\n- Use subcollections for relationships: `/users/{id}/orders`\\n\\n### 4. Proper HTTP Methods\\n\\n- **GET**: Retrieve resources (safe, idempotent)\\n- **POST**: Create new resources\\n- **PUT**: Update entire resource (idempotent)\\n- **PATCH**: Partial update\\n- **DELETE**: Remove resource (idempotent)\\n\\n### 5. Meaningful Status Codes\\n\\n**Success:**\\n- 200 OK: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE\\n- 201 Created: Successful POST\\n- 204 No Content: Successful request with no body\\n\\n**Client Errors:**\\n- 400 Bad Request: Invalid syntax\\n- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required\\n- 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions\\n- 404 Not Found: Resource doesn't exist\\n- 409 Conflict: Duplicate or conflicting resource\\n- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation errors\\n- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded\\n\\n**Server Errors:**\\n- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected error\\n- 503 Service Unavailable: Temporary unavailability\\n\\n### 6. Consistent Error Format\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"error\\\": {\\n    \\\"code\\\": \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\",\\n    \\\"message\\\": \\\"Invalid input data\\\",\\n    \\\"details\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"field\\\": \\\"email\\\",\\n        \\\"message\\\": \\\"Invalid email format\\\"\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \\\"requestId\\\": \\\"req_abc123\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 7. Pagination\\n\\nAlways paginate collections:\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/users?page=2&limit=20\\n\\nResponse:\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": [...],\\n  \\\"pagination\\\": {\\n    \\\"page\\\": 2,\\n    \\\"limit\\\": 20,\\n    \\\"total\\\": 150,\\n    \\\"pages\\\": 8\\n  },\\n  \\\"links\\\": {\\n    \\\"first\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=1&limit=20\\\",\\n    \\\"prev\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=1&limit=20\\\",\\n    \\\"next\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=3&limit=20\\\",\\n    \\\"last\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=8&limit=20\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 8. Filtering, Sorting, Searching\\n\\n```\\n# Filtering\\nGET /api/users?status=active&role=admin\\n\\n# Sorting\\nGET /api/users?sort=created_at&order=desc\\n\\n# Searching\\nGET /api/users?q=john\\n\\n# Field selection\\nGET /api/users?fields=id,name,email\\n```\\n\\n### 9. Versioning\\n\\nUse URL versioning:\\n```\\n/api/v1/users\\n/api/v2/users\\n```\\n\\nOr header versioning:\\n```\\nAccept: application/vnd.api.v2+json\\n```\\n\\n### 10. Security\\n\\n- Always use HTTPS\\n- Require authentication for sensitive endpoints\\n- Implement rate limiting\\n- Validate all inputs\\n- Sanitize outputs\\n- Use CORS appropriately\\n- Never expose sensitive data in URLs\\n\\n## Request/Response Patterns\\n\\n### GET Collection\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/users?page=1&limit=20\\n\\n200 OK\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": [\\n    {\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"name\\\": \\\"John\\\", \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\"},\\n    {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jane\\\", \\\"email\\\": \\\"jane@example.com\\\"}\\n  ],\\n  \\\"pagination\\\": {...}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### GET Single Resource\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/users/1\\n\\n200 OK\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": 1,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Doe\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2023-11-01T10:00:00Z\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### POST Create\\n\\n```\\nPOST /api/users\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Doe\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\"\\n}\\n\\n201 Created\\nLocation: /api/users/123\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": 123,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Doe\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2023-11-20T16:00:00Z\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### PUT Update\\n\\n```\\nPUT /api/users/123\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Smith\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"john.smith@example.com\\\"\\n}\\n\\n200 OK\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": 123,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Smith\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"john.smith@example.com\\\",\\n    \\\"updated_at\\\": \\\"2023-11-20T16:05:00Z\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### DELETE\\n\\n```\\nDELETE /api/users/123\\n\\n204 No Content\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nEvery API must have:\\n1.

RESTful Design\\n\\nFollow REST architectural constraints:\\n- **Client-Server**: Clear separation of concerns\\n- **Stateless**: Each request contains all needed information\\n- **Cacheable**: Responses explicitly indicate cacheability\\n- **Layered System**: Client cannot tell if connected directly to server\\n- **Uniform Interface**: Consistent resource identification and manipulation\\n\\n### 2. Resource-Oriented\\n\\nDesign around resources, not actions:\\n\\n```\\nGOOD:\\nGET /api/users/{id}\\nPOST /api/users\\nPUT /api/users/{id}\\nDELETE /api/users/{id}\\n\\nBAD:\\nGET /api/getUser?id=123\\nPOST /api/createUser\\nPOST /api/updateUser\\n```\\n\\n### 3. Consistent Naming\\n\\n- Use plural nouns for collections: `/users`, `/products`\\n- Use kebab-case for multi-word resources: `/user-profiles`\\n- Avoid verbs in URLs (use HTTP methods instead)\\n- Use subcollections for relationships: `/users/{id}/orders`\\n\\n### 4. Proper HTTP Methods\\n\\n- **GET**: Retrieve resources (safe, idempotent)\\n- **POST**: Create new resources\\n- **PUT**: Update entire resource (idempotent)\\n- **PATCH**: Partial update\\n- **DELETE**: Remove resource (idempotent)\\n\\n### 5. Meaningful Status Codes\\n\\n**Success:**\\n- 200 OK: Successful GET, PUT, PATCH, DELETE\\n- 201 Created: Successful POST\\n- 204 No Content: Successful request with no body\\n\\n**Client Errors:**\\n- 400 Bad Request: Invalid syntax\\n- 401 Unauthorized: Authentication required\\n- 403 Forbidden: Insufficient permissions\\n- 404 Not Found: Resource doesn't exist\\n- 409 Conflict: Duplicate or conflicting resource\\n- 422 Unprocessable Entity: Validation errors\\n- 429 Too Many Requests: Rate limit exceeded\\n\\n**Server Errors:**\\n- 500 Internal Server Error: Unexpected error\\n- 503 Service Unavailable: Temporary unavailability\\n\\n### 6. Consistent Error Format\\n\\n```json\\n{\\n  \\\"error\\\": {\\n    \\\"code\\\": \\\"VALIDATION_ERROR\\\",\\n    \\\"message\\\": \\\"Invalid input data\\\",\\n    \\\"details\\\": [\\n      {\\n        \\\"field\\\": \\\"email\\\",\\n        \\\"message\\\": \\\"Invalid email format\\\"\\n      }\\n    ],\\n    \\\"requestId\\\": \\\"req_abc123\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 7. Pagination\\n\\nAlways paginate collections:\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/users?page=2&limit=20\\n\\nResponse:\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": [...],\\n  \\\"pagination\\\": {\\n    \\\"page\\\": 2,\\n    \\\"limit\\\": 20,\\n    \\\"total\\\": 150,\\n    \\\"pages\\\": 8\\n  },\\n  \\\"links\\\": {\\n    \\\"first\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=1&limit=20\\\",\\n    \\\"prev\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=1&limit=20\\\",\\n    \\\"next\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=3&limit=20\\\",\\n    \\\"last\\\": \\\"/api/users?page=8&limit=20\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### 8. Filtering, Sorting, Searching\\n\\n```\\n# Filtering\\nGET /api/users?status=active&role=admin\\n\\n# Sorting\\nGET /api/users?sort=created_at&order=desc\\n\\n# Searching\\nGET /api/users?q=john\\n\\n# Field selection\\nGET /api/users?fields=id,name,email\\n```\\n\\n### 9. Versioning\\n\\nUse URL versioning:\\n```\\n/api/v1/users\\n/api/v2/users\\n```\\n\\nOr header versioning:\\n```\\nAccept: application/vnd.api.v2+json\\n```\\n\\n### 10. Security\\n\\n- Always use HTTPS\\n- Require authentication for sensitive endpoints\\n- Implement rate limiting\\n- Validate all inputs\\n- Sanitize outputs\\n- Use CORS appropriately\\n- Never expose sensitive data in URLs\\n\\n## Request/Response Patterns\\n\\n### GET Collection\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/users?page=1&limit=20\\n\\n200 OK\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": [\\n    {\\\"id\\\": 1, \\\"name\\\": \\\"John\\\", \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\"},\\n    {\\\"id\\\": 2, \\\"name\\\": \\\"Jane\\\", \\\"email\\\": \\\"jane@example.com\\\"}\\n  ],\\n  \\\"pagination\\\": {...}\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### GET Single Resource\\n\\n```\\nGET /api/users/1\\n\\n200 OK\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": 1,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Doe\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2023-11-01T10:00:00Z\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### POST Create\\n\\n```\\nPOST /api/users\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Doe\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\"\\n}\\n\\n201 Created\\nLocation: /api/users/123\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": 123,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Doe\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"john@example.com\\\",\\n    \\\"created_at\\\": \\\"2023-11-20T16:00:00Z\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### PUT Update\\n\\n```\\nPUT /api/users/123\\n{\\n  \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Smith\\\",\\n  \\\"email\\\": \\\"john.smith@example.com\\\"\\n}\\n\\n200 OK\\n{\\n  \\\"data\\\": {\\n    \\\"id\\\": 123,\\n    \\\"name\\\": \\\"John Smith\\\",\\n    \\\"email\\\": \\\"john.smith@example.com\\\",\\n    \\\"updated_at\\\": \\\"2023-11-20T16:05:00Z\\\"\\n  }\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### DELETE\\n\\n```\\nDELETE /api/users/123\\n\\n204 No Content\\n```\\n\\n## Documentation\\n\\nEvery API must have:\\n1.
