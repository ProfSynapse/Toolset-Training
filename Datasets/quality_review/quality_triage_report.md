## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Impact)

1. **Add Result structures to all examples** (3472 need this)
   - Include realistic metadata: executionTime, totalResults, searchCapabilities
   - Add realistic scores/confidence values (not always 1.0)
   - Show edge cases: warnings, partial results, informative failures

2. **Enrich sessionMemory fields** (1441 empty)
   - Replace empty strings with contextual information
   - Reference specific prior tool calls: "Searched 23 files via vaultLibrarian_searchContent"
   - Include concrete details: numbers, paths, results
   - Minimum 50 chars with high information density

3. **Enhance toolContext reasoning** (100 generic)
   - Explain WHY this tool was chosen (not just WHAT it does)
   - Show workflow reasoning: "After confirming path via search, now appending content"
   - Consider alternatives: "Using append instead of replace to preserve existing entries"

### Medium Priority

4. **Add metadata to responses** (49 minimal)
   - executionTime (ms)
   - Timestamps
   - Result counts (totalResults, displayed, filtered)
   - Capability flags (semanticSearch, workspaceFiltering)

5. **Strengthen goal hierarchies** (287 weak)
   - Ensure primaryGoal and subgoal are distinct
   - Show strategic decomposition, not just restatement
   - Subgoal should indicate current step in larger workflow

### Long-term Improvements

6. **Increase prompt diversity**
   - More ambiguous prompts requiring inference
   - References to implicit context: "that folder we created"
   - Corrections and clarifications: "Actually, make that Friday"
   - Domain-specific language (technical, creative, personal)

7. **Include more error scenarios**
   - Realistic failures with helpful error messages
   - Recovery workflows (retry with different parameters)
   - Edge cases (missing files, permission issues)

## Next Steps

1. **Review high-priority examples** (bottom 20%) using this report
2. **Apply enhancements** following the recommendations
3. **Use template examples** (top 10%) as reference for quality standards
4. **Re-score enhanced examples** to validate improvements
5. **Extrapolate patterns** to improve remaining 5,355 unscored examples

## Appendix: Scoring Methodology

- **Rubric:** 5-point scale across 5 dimensions
- **Sample Size:** 5518 examples (100.2% of 5,505)
- **Statistical Target:** 408 examples (achieved 1352.5%)
- **Sampling:** Complete dataset coverage across 7 rounds
  - Rounds 1-3: 450 examples (batches 1-15, 5 agents per round)
  - Round 4: 450 examples (batches 16-30, 15 agents)
  - Round 5: 900 examples (batches 31-60, 30 agents)
  - Round 6: 1,800 examples (batches 61-120, 60 agents)
  - Round 7: 2,355 examples (batches 121-184, 64 agents) ← **100% COMPLETE!**
- **Scoring:** 184 parallel agents total following detailed rubric
- **Output:** Scored examples with detailed reasoning notes

**Files Generated:**
- `scored_batch_[1-184].jsonl` - Individual batch scores
- `scored_complete.jsonl` - Merged scored dataset (5518 examples - 100% of dataset!)
- `quality_triage_report.md` - This report
