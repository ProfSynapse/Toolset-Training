{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "completion": "Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data and improve their performance without being explicitly programmed. It uses algorithms to identify patterns in data and make predictions or decisions.", "label": true}
{"prompt": "What is machine learning?", "completion": "It's when computers do stuff.", "label": false}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.", "completion": "Supervised learning uses labeled data where the correct output is known during training, allowing the model to learn the mapping between inputs and outputs. Unsupervised learning works with unlabeled data, discovering hidden patterns and structures without predefined categories.", "label": true}
{"prompt": "Explain the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning.", "completion": "One has supervision and the other doesn't.", "label": false}
{"prompt": "What is a neural network?", "completion": "A neural network is a computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) organized in layers. It processes information through weighted connections, learning to recognize patterns and make predictions through training.", "label": true}
{"prompt": "What is a neural network?", "completion": "A network of neural things.", "label": false}
{"prompt": "How does gradient descent work?", "completion": "Gradient descent is an optimization algorithm that iteratively adjusts model parameters to minimize a loss function. It calculates the gradient (slope) of the loss with respect to each parameter and moves in the opposite direction of the gradient to find the minimum.", "label": true}
{"prompt": "How does gradient descent work?", "completion": "It goes down gradients.", "label": false}
